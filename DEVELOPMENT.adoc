[[development-dependencies]]
=== üìå Development Dependencies
The Dependencies of this Project are defined in `package.json`.
Install via:

----
$ npm install -D
----

The Dependencies of Additional Development Tools are defined in a
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files[python pip requirements file]
named `requirements-dev.txt`.
Example Installation Instructions for Linux are shown below:

----
# "optional": create a python virtualenv and activate it for the current shell session

[[testing]]
=== üß™ Testing
Automatic Tests are run on each Contribution using GitHub Workflows.

To run the tests, simply run `npm run build` followed by `npm run test` on the command line.


[[packaging]]
=== üì¶ Packaging

As defined in `action.yml`, the primary entry point for this action is `dist/index.js`.
This bundled file needs to be *generated* by issuing `npm run build` followed by `npm run package`.

[TIP]
Packaging is performed on each contribution by a GitHub workflow,
which automatically commits the generated files back to the repository.

[[versioning]]
=== üî¢ Versioning

Versions are defined using https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging[Tags].

Versions must start with `v`.

Note that major version tags (e.g. `v1`, `v2`)
are basically just pointers to the latest version
within said major version constraint (e.g. `v1.2.3`).
This is accomplished through the use of a GitHub Workflow
that issues https://github.com/nowactions/update-majorver[nowactions/update-majorver]
on each push of a tag starting with `v`.

[[cookiecutter]]
=== üç™ CookieCutter

This Project shall be kept in sync with
https://github.com/JonasPammer/cookiecutter-github-action-typescript[the CookieCutter it was originally templated from]
using https://github.com/cruft/cruft[cruft] (if possible) or manual alteration (if needed)
to the best extend possible.

[[changelog]]
=== üïó Changelog
When a new tag is pushed, an appropriate GitHub Release will be created
by the Repository Maintainer to provide a proper human change log with a title and description.


[[pre-commit]]
=== ‚ÑπÔ∏è General Linting and Styling Conventions
General Linting and Styling Conventions are
https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/07/20/linters-arent-in-your-way-theyre-on-your-side/[*automatically* held up to Standards]
by various https://pre-commit.com/[`pre-commit`] hooks, at least to some extend.

Automatic Execution of pre-commit is done on each Contribution using
https://pre-commit.ci/[`pre-commit.ci`]<<note_pre-commit-ci,*>>.
Pull Requests even automatically get fixed by the same tool,
at least by hooks that automatically alter files.

[NOTE]
Not to confuse:
Although some pre-commit hooks may be able to warn you about script-analyzed flaws in syntax or even code to some extend (for which reason pre-commit's hooks are *part of* the test suite),
pre-commit itself does not run any real Test Suites.
For Information on Testing, see <<testing>>.

[TIP]
====
[[note_pre-commit-ci]]
Nevertheless, I recommend you to integrate pre-commit into your local development workflow yourself.

This can be done by cd'ing into the directory of your cloned project and running `pre-commit install`.
Doing so will make git run pre-commit checks on every commit you make,
aborting the commit themselves if a hook alarm'ed.

You can also, for example, execute pre-commit's hooks at any time by running `pre-commit run --all-files`.
